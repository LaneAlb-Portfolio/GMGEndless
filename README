[From the Assignment Sheet]
...do something technically interesting? Are you particularly proud of a programming technique you implemented?
Did you look beyond the class examples and learn how to do something new? (5)

...have a great visual style? Does it use music or art that you're particularly proud of? 
Are you trying something new or clever with the endless runner form? (5)

[Our Response]
[Lane]
Particle Emitters following the meteor physics objects. Not only is it cool, but was surprisingly already supported by Phaser so it didnâ€™t require any fancy coding.
Also the way the meteor and wall objects have completely random size, varying art assets, and speeds was a nice touch which was inspired by the randomized hex color
maker that resided in Paddle Parkour is a small but powerful piece of code.


[Mikayla]
(Visual Style) The style is heavily linked to the main mechanic of the game- that being gravity inversion, a concept often tied to space and science fiction.
The background, character, obstacles, and sound design all follow this space/scify theme, and I'm very happy with how it turned out. Style, sound, and animation
concepts were drawn from lectures, previous classes, and previous experience, blending together to make a thematically cohesive experience. I'm especially happy
with the sound design- its a newer experience for me personally, and I believe it turned out great. The chippy, bitcrushed sounds and tunes all fit very well with
the pixel style. 
(Endless Runner Form) When thinking of what to do with our game, we drew from previous endless runners we've played- Temple Run, JetPack Joyride, and so on. Something
 we hadn't seen however was a game that used, rather than jumping, a gravity-inversion mechanic to avoid projectiles. The mechanic allows for unique dodging and survival
 strategy, and fits very well with our art and sound design, making the game fun, new, and thematically cohesive.

[Josh]
Though I did little programming on this project, I am proud of how much i learned while reading Lane's code. As far as art/asset wise I am proud of what I could find, modify,
and bring to table to aid in understanding the production path of this project.

Structure and Design (75 points) Checklist:
[Y] Use multiple Scene classes (defined by your game's style) (5)
[Y] Properly transition between Scenes and allow the player to restart w/out having to reload the page (5)
[Y] Communicate how to play w/ clear, proofread, in-game instructions (5)
[Y] Have some form of player input/control appropriate to your game design (5)
[Y] Include one or more animated characters that use a texture atlas (5)
[Y] Simulate scrolling with a tileSprite or equivalent means (5)
[Y] Implement proper collision detection (via Arcade Physics or your own detection routine) (5)
[Y] Have looping background music (5)
[Y] Use sound effects for key mechanics, UI, and/or significant events appropriate to your game design (5)
[Y] Use randomness to generate challenge, e.g. terrain, pickups, etc. (5)
[Y] Include some metric of accomplishment that a player can improve over time, e.g., score, survival time, etc. (5)
[Y] Be theoretically endless (5)
[Y] Be playable for at least 15 seconds for a new player of low to moderate skill (5)
[Y] Run without significant crashes or errors (5)
[Y] Include in-game credits for all roles, assets, music, etc. (5)

Lane's Checklist:
[Y] load screen
[Y] make white_cross something else probably
[Y] new font
[Y] character texture atlas
[] ~~player x velocity bug fixes~~ fixed? i think
[] ~~gravity after invert probably~~ make it stronger prob
[Y] ~~import sounds~~
[Y] import imgs
[Y] ~~am i cracked enough to do a marathon overnight I guess so~~
[Y] ~~in-game credits (separate scene or after death to menu) not sure which~~
[?] COMMENT ALL CODE THAT WAS INSPIRED BY NATHANS EXAMPLE
